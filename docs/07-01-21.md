# Progress update

Read the password correction typo paper in depth and asked a mathematician in my family to verify that the maths in the paper checks out
* main argument is that the paper considers an optimal attacker (an attacker that knows that password distribution)
    * given that the attacker is optimal, the best possible attack consists in sorting the passwords by frequency and start guessing by using the password with the highest frequency
    * knowing this is the best attack, we can simply avoid typo-correcting a submitted password if has a high probability of appearing given a password distribution (RockYou, Twitter passwords etc )
* given that any password in ball of the user's selected password will allow the user to login, the attacker must guess the passwords whose ball has the highest aggregate probability. It turns out that implementing this attack is NP-hard because finding the optimal set of queries is an instance of the weighted max cover problem
* what the paper doesn't really consider is the case of a true attacker who makes guesses by using a PCFG cracker
    * in practice it would take a lot of time to run experiments with this so I'm hesitating to go down this road
    * Skimmed a paper about different password cracking approaches and there respective success rates (PCFG, hashcat, john the ripper, markov model & Pros)Figure 3: Success guessing Complex passwords. Pros

Read lots of papers by the same author:
* TypTop system where authentication system learns over time the typos made by a specific user
    * ! there is a loss in security if the server state is stolen by an attacker, because the attacker can more easily run a brute-force dictionary attack
* tPAKE: typo-tolerant Password Authenticated Key Exchange. Apply the ideas from TypTop and combine with PAKE (enable a user to authenticate to a server by providing the knowledge of the password without revealing what the password is. PAKE protectss user passwords from being revealed to an adversary who compromises the server)

Today I plan on keeping up with the litterature review while also getting started with the project proposal I have to hand in on Friday

Should we keep on meeting on Mondays @ 2pm?
